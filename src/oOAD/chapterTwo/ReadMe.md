BEST PRACTICES BUILDING 
1. Do a requirements gathering from the client
2. Figure out, yourself, what the product should really
do and what other requirements there might be
3. Get additional information from the clients to see about what else they might want
4. Build things the right way.

Requirements is a specific thing that your system has to do to work correctly
Specific thing - one thing that can be tested\
System - the complete app being built
do - the exact function open and close for instance that is expected to be done
work - working and functioning the right way

A requirement is a single thing that a produdt should be or do. Listen to hear what the system\
want to do. You can figure out later how the system is going to do it.

The best way to get a good requirement is to understand what the system is supposed to do\
